## Description

This app was inspired by needs of many friends, family and others who desire greater control over their personal financial planning; Informed, USER-controlled financial insights should be accessible to everyone, regardless of one's familiarity with spreadsheet software.

This full-stack web app is designed to make personal financial planning both easy and comprehensive. The user experiences a smooth and intuitive UI comprised of a toolset of financial widgets. That experience is powered by sophisticated and  automated financial planning logic, programmed to provide valuable analysis, tracking and reporting on each user's unique situation.

At this stage of development, the app covers the topics of budgeting, cashflows, and retirement planning - with many more features on the way.

## Implemented Widgets/Features

### User Accounts 
1. Users can create an account with email/password
2. Users can update their login credentials
3. Users can delete their account
4. Passwords are hashed for security
4. Partial-validation of credentials - because this app is being actively demoed, I've temporarily allowed invalid email addresses for testing user registration/login. However, the form control will reject email addresses not conforming to proper formatting i.e. "example@somesite.com". Note that accounts created with invalid email addresses will be purged in the near future.
5. Ability to save changes made during session
