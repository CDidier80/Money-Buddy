## Description

This app was inspired by needs of many friends, family and others who desire greater control over their personal financial planning; Informed, USER-controlled financial insights should be accessible to everyone, regardless of one's familiarity with spreadsheet software.

This full-stack web app is designed to make personal financial planning both easy and comprehensive. The user experiences a smooth and intuitive UI comprised of a toolset of financial widgets. That experience is powered by sophisticated and  automated financial planning logic, programmed to provide valuable analysis, tracking and reporting on each user's unique situation.

At this state of development, the app covers the topics of budgeting, cashflows, and retirement planning - with many more features on the way.
